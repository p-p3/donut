+ The project represents my improvement and study on Programming and Math to achieve my first goal in programming: Doing a C DONUT rotating in the screen

 + I will use C++ to the first model, I think it will help me to do math operations and display the model on the screen, 
also, it will help me to organize my code using classes <br><br>

 + The main goal is to achieve a ridiculously good (in every way, memory, CPU performance, speed, etc) C DONUT Model.

<br><br>

<div align="center">
Also, the projects implies in modeling a donut in every programming language that I am studying: 
 
```JavaScript``` ```PHP``` ```Java``` ```C#``` ```Assembly```

The repository is organized in the follow way
