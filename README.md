THE PRESENT REPOSITORY SHOWS THE IMPROVMENT THAT I AM DOING TO ACHIEVE THE FIRST GOAL I HAD IN PROGRAMMING: DOING A C DONUT 
===========================================================================================================================

I will use C++ to the first model, I think it will help me to do math operations and display the model on the screen
The main goal is to achieve a ridiculously good (in every way, memory, CPU performance, speed, etc) C DONUT Model

After that, I will make a model of a donut in every programming language that I like/I am studying: 

JS, Java, C#, PHP, Assembly, etc.

This repository is planned to be organized that way:
