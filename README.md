C DONUT MODEL
=============

I will use C++ to the first model, I think it will help me to do math operations and display the model on the screen, 
also, it will help me to organize my code using classes
The main goal is to achieve a ridiculously good (in every way, memory, CPU performance, speed, etc) C DONUT Model

After that, I will make a model of a donut in every programming language that I like/I am studying: 

JavaScript, PHP, Java, C#, Assembly, etc.

The repository is organized in the follow way
